#E-Commerce Product Recommendation System
This project implements a product recommendation system using two approaches:

    1. Rank-Based Recommendations
    2. User-Based Collaborative Filtering
An interactive interface is provided using Streamlit to allow users to explore and interact with these recommendation systems.


Features
    1. Rank-Based Recommendation: Suggests popular products based on average user ratings.
    2. User-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends products by finding similar users and suggesting items they liked.
    3. Streamlit App: User-friendly interface for testing and visualizing recommendations interactively.
